# Introduction (a.k.a Welcome)

The purpose of this Wiki is to act as a central repository for useful information, documentation and any other material meaningful to the staff, partners and customers of AssitWeb. A set of guidelines will eventually be published to this page outlining what is expected with respect to the content of all pages published in this Wiki.

Please note that the full page structure of this wiki is not yet finalized and pages are actively being added.
